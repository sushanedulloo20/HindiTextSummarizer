# Efficient Hindi Text Summarization via Knowledge Distillation of MT5 üìù

This project focuses on Hindi text summarization using a Hindi news Article [dataset](https://ilsum.github.io/ilsum/2024/index.html) utilizing advanced techniques in natural language processing. Most of the multilingual Models available are quite large in size and require high computaional resources .By leveraging the knowledge distillation of the **mT5** model, we aim to create a more efficient and smaller version of **mT5** (Distill mT5) that retains the essential capabilities for summarizing Hindi texts.
